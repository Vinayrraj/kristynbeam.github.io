## hello world

### blogging in medicine

______________

When I transitioned this year from fully clinical to a research focus, I had a couple of things on my "to-do list". However, this time around, it is with a focus on the future of my career rather than getting into the next residency or fellowship position, as it has always been before. Although obviously getting into residency and fellowship are components of my career, now that the basics of medical practice have been established, developing other strengths as part of my career is important. 

### one of these goals was to start a blog. 

I've never been that into writing. The extent of my professional writing has been in the form of research articles and personal statements, the latter of which is quite possibly the most awkward 1,000 words to put on a piece of paper. I've mostly enjoyed the type of writing of facts - clinical notes, nothing with flowery language. At this point in my life I have written at least 5 personal statements describing to "Whom It May Concern" why I, at the same time, am a great candidate for said particular position, I also have short-comings that can only be satisfied by their particular program. It is an exercise in humility and bragging, with just the right amount of confidence and assurance that if they select you, they will not be disappointed. 

As I have just completed my fifth personal statement over the last 15 years, I am moving to writing this first blog post as a place to work on my writing and expression of thought over the next few years. Just as I practice medicine on a daily basis, I should practice writing. Practice may not make perfect, but practice does help develop new skills, as I have learned over the past 4 years of residency and fellowship. I will view this blog as an outlet for thoughts on research medicine, personal life, interactions between the two, and  anything else that crosses my mind.

### hello again, world

With that in mind, let me introduce myself. My name is Kristyn Beam. I am currently a Neonatology Fellow at the Harvard Combined Neonatal-Perinatal Fellowship program. I have just completed my first year of fellowship and have two years left. The first year flew by and I know the next two will as well. The amount I learned over the last year feels like all three years of Pediatric Residency in one year.  

In this next phase of training, I am attempting to combine machine learning techniques and Neonatology to improve outcomes in infants. This really hasn't been done before, but I think with the available mentors in the Boston area, it could be a very exciting new field of research. 

### So here it is. My first blog post. Let's practice.
