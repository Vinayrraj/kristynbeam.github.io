## Blogging in Medicine

When I transitioned this year from fully clinical to a research focus, I had a couple of things on my "to-do list". However, this time around, it is with a focus on the future of my career rather than getting into the next residency or fellowship position, as it has always been before. One of these goals was to start a blog. 

I've never been that into writing. The extent of my professional writing has been in the form of research articles and personal statements, the latter of which is quite possibly the most awkward 1,000 words to put on a piece of paper. At this point in my life I have written at least 5 personal statements describing to "Whom It May Concern" why I, at the same time, am a great candidate for said particular position, I also have short-comings that can only be satisfied by their particular program. It is an exercise in humility and bragging, with just the right amount of confidence and assurance that if they select you, they will not be disappointed. 

As I have just completed my fifth personal statement over the last 15 years, I am moving to writing this first blog post as a place to work on my writing and expression of thought over the next few years. Just as I practice medicine on a daily basis, I should also attempt to practice writing. Practice may not make perfect, but practice does help develop new skills, just as I have learned over the past 4 years of residency and fellowship. I will view this blog as an outlet for thoughts on medicine, personal life, interactions between the two, and  anything else that crosses my mind.
